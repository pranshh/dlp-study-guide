# 1. Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to evaluate two popular pretrained convolutional neural networks—**VGG16** and **ResNet18**—on the ImageNet-mini validation dataset using PyTorch. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model loading, and performance evaluation, providing a practical example of transfer learning and model benchmarking.

# 2. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

## 2.1. Importing Libraries

The following libraries are used:

- `torch`: Core PyTorch library for deep learning.
- `torchvision`: For datasets, models, and image transformations.
- `os`: For file path management.

```{python}
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder
from torchvision.models import vgg16, resnet18
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import os
```

## 2.2. Device Setup

The code automatically selects a GPU if available, otherwise defaults to CPU.

```{python}
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")
```

## 2.3. Image Transformations

Images are preprocessed to match the input requirements of VGG16 and ResNet18:

- Resize to 256 pixels (shorter side).
- Center crop to 224×224 pixels.
- Convert to tensor.
- Normalize using ImageNet mean and standard deviation.

```{python}
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])
```

## 2.4. Loading the Dataset

The validation set from ImageNet-mini is loaded using `ImageFolder`, which expects images to be organized in subfolders by class.

```{python}
dataset_path = '/kaggle/input/imagenetmini-1000/imagenet-mini'
val_dataset = ImageFolder(root=os.path.join(dataset_path, 'val'), transform=transform)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=128, shuffle=False)
print(f"Validation set size: {len(val_dataset)}")
```

# 3. Model Evaluation Function

A reusable function is defined to evaluate any model on the validation set. It computes the overall accuracy by comparing predicted and true labels.

```{python}
def evaluate_model(model, data_loader, device='cuda'):
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for inputs, labels in data_loader:
            inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
            outputs = model(inputs)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    return correct / total
```

# 4. Evaluating VGG16

## 4.1. Loading the Pretrained Model

The VGG16 model is loaded with pretrained ImageNet weights and moved to the selected device.

```{python}
vgg_model = vgg16(pretrained=True).to(device)
```

**Model Architecture Overview:**

- Features: 13 convolutional layers (all 3×3), interleaved with ReLU activations and max pooling.
- Classifier: Three fully connected layers (4096, 4096, 1000 units), with dropout for regularization.

## 4.2. Model Summary

The model summary shows the sequence of convolutional, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers, matching the classic VGG16 design.

```{python}
print(vgg_model)
```

## 4.3. Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the validation set:

```{python}
vgg_accuracy = evaluate_model(vgg_model, val_loader, device=device)
print(f'VGG16 Accuracy on ImageNet: {vgg_accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

_Result:_  
VGG16 achieves an accuracy of approximately **70.41%** on the ImageNet-mini validation set.

# 5. Evaluating ResNet18

## 5.1. Loading the Pretrained Model

The ResNet18 model is loaded with pretrained ImageNet weights and moved to the device.

```{python}
resnet_model = resnet18(pretrained=True).to(device)
```

**Model Architecture Overview:**

- Initial Layer: 7×7 convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, and max pooling.
- Residual Blocks: Four groups of residual blocks (with skip connections), each increasing the number of channels (64, 128, 256, 512).
- Global Average Pooling: Reduces each feature map to a single value.
- Fully Connected Layer: Outputs 1000 class scores.

## 5.2. Model Summary

The summary details the sequence of convolutional, batch normalization, activation, pooling, and residual blocks, characteristic of ResNet architectures.

```{python}
print(resnet_model)
```

## 5.3. Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the validation set:

```{python}
resnet_accuracy = evaluate_model(resnet_model, val_loader, device=device)
print(f'ResNet18 Accuracy on ImageNet: {resnet_accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

_Result:_  
ResNet18 achieves an accuracy of approximately **69.97%** on the ImageNet-mini validation set.
